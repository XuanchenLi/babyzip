A simple Huffman-based compression software writtened by C++ and STL.

The software uses Huffman Tree to express and expand text files that encoded by ASCII.

It can be used online and offline.

The software can tell the user the Huffman code of each character that appears in the file, and can also show the compression ratio of the file.

The extra function of the software is comparing the differences of two files.This function can help to tell the user whether the expression works well.

The suffix of the expressed file is ".lxced" and the suffix of the expanded file is ".lxc".

Test files are offered to help you to familiarize the software :)
